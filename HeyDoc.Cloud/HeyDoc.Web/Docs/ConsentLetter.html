                                    I understand that this platform may include the practice of healthcare delivery, information sharing, transfer of health
                                    related data using interactive text or picture messages, audio, video or data communication in accordance with the Telemedicine Act 1997 Malaysia.

                                    of diseases/ailments and treatments cannot be performed via virtual consultation (text, audio, video or email) alone in view of its limitation.

                                        risking the loss of withdrawal of any program benefits to which I would otherwise be entitled.

                                        The Personal Data Protection Act, 2010 that protects the confidentiality of my medical or personal health information apply to
                                        Telehealth/Telemedicine. As such, I understand that the information disclosed by me during the session in this platform is confidential
                                        and shall remain confidential at all times. I also understand that the dissemination of any personal identifiable images or information
                                        from this interaction shall not occur without my consent. However, I authorise the release of my relevant medical or personal health
                                        information to the attending health care provider and/or its supervisor who may need this information for continuing care purposes.

                                        I understand that there are risks and consequences from Telemedicine/Telehealth, including, but not limited to the possibility,
                                        that the transmission of my medical information could be disrupted or distorted by technical failure.

                                        I understand that Telemedicine/Telehealth based services and care may not be as complete as face-to-face consultation.
                                        I also understand that if my doctor believes I would be better served by a face-to-face consultation, I would be advised as such.

                                        I understand that Telemedicine/Telehealth is not appropriate for medical emergencies and that it is best sought by seeking care at the emergency department.

                                        I understand that a physical examination will not take place during the session and this will limit the diagnosis and/or treatment of the disease/ailments.

                                        service of Telehealth/Telemedicine and I shall hold the service providers harmless against all claims, actions, suits and/or proceedings arising from the
                                        use of this Telehealth/Telemedicine platform, save for negligence, willful default and fraud on the part of the service providers, their staff, employees
                                        and/or medical practitioners engaged through the Telemedicine/Telehealth platform.
