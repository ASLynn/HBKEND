                                    partners or subsidiaries as a result of the Terms and Conditions or use of the Service.</b> Nothing contained in this Agreement shall 
                                    be construed to make one party the agent or partner for the other for any purpose, and neither of the parties hereto shall have any 
                                    right whatsoever to incur any obligations or liabilities on behalf of or binding on the other party. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If any provision of the Terms and Conditions is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall be 
                                    enforced to the fullest extent under law. This shall, without limitation, also apply to the applicable law and jurisdiction 
                                    as stipulated above. The failure of the Company to enforce any right or provision in the Terms and Conditions shall not 
                                    constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by the Company in writing. These Terms and 
                                    Conditions and any changes or modification made from time to time comprises the entire agreement between you and the Company 
                                    and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous negotiations or discussions, whether written or oral (if any) between the parties 
                                    regarding the subject matter contained herein.

                                    notice to you without assigning any reasons. Notwithstanding the generality of the provisions stipulated in 
                                    this Agreement or anything to the contrary, the Company is entitled to terminate this Agreement immediately 
                                    in the event that you are found to be in breach of any of the terms stipulated in this Agreement. For the 
                                    avoidance of doubt, the termination of this Agreement shall not require the Company to compensate, reimburse 
                                    or cover any cost incurred by you, including but not limited to the credit reserved with the Company or any 
                                    other monies paid to the Company in the course of performing your obligations under this Agreement.
